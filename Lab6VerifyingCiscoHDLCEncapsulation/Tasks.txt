Lab 6. Verifying Cisco HDLC Encapsulation

Lab Objective:
The objective of this lab exercise is to verify Cisco HDLC
encapsulation, which is the default encapsulation method for WAN
interfaces on Cisco IOS routers.
Lab Purpose:
Cisco HDLC verification is a fundamental skill. Cisco HDLC
encapsulation is the default encapsulation on all Cisco router Serial
interfaces. As a Cisco engineer, as well as in the Cisco CCNA exam,
you will be expected to know how to verify Cisco HDLC
encapsulation.
Task 1:
Configure hostnames on R1 and R2 as illustrated in the topology.
Task 2:
Enable Serial interfaces on R1 and R2. The Serial0/0 interface on
R2 is identified as the DCE in the topology. Configure the DCE
interface on R2 to provide clocking to R1. The clock speed should be256 Kbps. Remember that 1 Kbps = 1000 bps. Verify that R2 is
sending clocking information and that R1 receives this information
from R2.
Task 3:
Configure IP addressing on R1 and R2 Serial0/0 interfaces as
illustrated in the topology. Verify your interface encapsulation, which
should be HDLC by default.
Task 4:
Enable debugging on the Cisco router to validate that HDLC
keepalive messages are being sent between the two routers. Ensure
that you disable debugging when you are finished. Verify that HDLC
messages are sent in the keepalive interval that is listed under the
interface, which should be approximately every 10 seconds.
