Lab . Configuring Back-toBack Serial Connections

Lab Objective:
The objective of this lab exercise is to configure back-to-back Serial
interfaces between two Cisco routers. By default, router Serial
interfaces receive their clocking information from an external device
such as a CSU/DSU.
Lab Purpose:
Back-to-back Serial interface configuration is a fundamental skill.
Because routers typically receive clocking from an external device
such as a CSU/DSU, it is imperative to understand how to bring up a
back-to-back Serial connection between two routers to set up your
home lab, for example. As a Cisco engineer, as well as in the Cisco
CCNA exam, you will be expected to know how to configure back-toback Serial connections.
Task 1:
Configure hostnames on R1 and R2 as illustrated in the topology.
Task 2:Enable Serial interfaces on R1 and R2. The Serial0/0 interface on
R2 is identified as the DCE in the topology. Use the appropriate show
command to verify that this interface is indeed the DCE.
Task 3:
Configure the DCE interface on R2 to provide clocking to R1. The
clock speed should be 560 Kbps. Remember that 1 Kbps = 1000
bps. Verify that R1 receives clocking information from R2.
Task 4:
Configure IP addressing on R1 and R2 Serial0/0 interfaces as
illustrated in the topology.
Task 5:
Verify your interface status and ping between R1 and R2 to validate
connectivity
