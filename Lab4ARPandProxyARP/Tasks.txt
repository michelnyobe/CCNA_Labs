Lab . ARP and Proxy ARP

Lab Objective:
The objective of this lab exercise is for you to learn and understand
how ARP and Proxy ARP is used by the router in order to
encapsulate the packet before it is sent to a neighbor device.

Lab Purpose:
You must understand how ARP works in order to pass the CCNA
exam. You could well be faced with an ARP-related issue to
troubleshoot in the exam or in the real world.
Task 1:
Configure the hostnames on routers R1, R2, and R3 as illustrated in
the topology.
Task 2:
Configure the IP addresses on the Ethernet interfaces of R1, R2,
and R3 as illustrated in the topology (.1 for R1 and .2 for R2, and
then .1 and .2 between R2 and R3).
Add static routes so that R1 can ping the host address on R3 and R3
can return the ping. Then check the ARP cache on R1. A default
route for all traffic to leave via the Ethernet interface will do.
Task 3:
Use the correct show commands to check:
1. The ARP cache on R1. What are the times for the learned
addresses? Which will not timeout and how can you tell?
2. What is the entry for R3 and why is it the same as the R2
Ethernet interface?
3. What does the “–” in the ARP table mean?
